Despite Balbir being a strict father, Vijay's love for his father is deep and abiding.

Vijay finishes his education and returns home after several years. During Balbir's birthday party, Vijay gets into an argument with his brother-in-law Varun, prompting Balbir to expel him from the house again.

He rounds up his cousins from the village for backup and recruits a body double for his father, who is eventually killed by a gangster named Asrar Haque. Vijay discovers Varun's role in the assassination attempt and kills him publicly at a conference with his cousins, where Asrar is also present.\n",

He wakes up after two weeks and undergoes a heart transplant for his failing heart. Meanwhile, in Scotland, Asrar's brother Abrar Haque learns of his death during Abrar's third wedding and kills one of his men publicly at the wedding. Abrar and his other brother Abid go to a house where they shoot the man who was keeping tabs on Asrar revealing Abrar was the one who planned the assassination attempt on Balbir. Vijay recuperates after several months and is approached by Zoya, the fiancée of his heart donor. Vijay starts an extramartial affair with Zoya, who eventually reveals that she was sent by Abrar to honey trap him, so that one of his brothers who transformed himself into another Vijay, would kill his family, but Vijay reveals that he had already knew this and played along to learn the mastermind's identity.\n",

Shamsher's son Azim, who had converted to Islam and married a couple of times, was denied any share in Balbir's assets, which prompted Shamsher to commit suicide by setting himself on fire.
